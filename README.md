# Endpoint Health Monitor

This tool monitors the availability of multiple HTTP endpoints as defined in a YAML configuration file. It performs periodic checks, evaluates the responses based on availability criteria, and logs aggregated availability per domain.

---

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your_repo_url_here>
   cd <your_repo_directory>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   On Mac/Linux:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   On Windows:
   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

Run the monitoring script with a YAML config file:

```bash
python main.py sample.yaml
```

Each run will:
- Check all endpoints every 15 seconds
- Evaluate response status and latency
- Aggregate and log availability by domain
- Create a timestamped log file (e.g. health_check_2025-04-20_17-11-40.log)

The program will continue running until interrupted (Ctrl+C).

## Configuration File Format

The configuration file should be in YAML format with the following structure:

```yaml
- name: endpoint_name
  url: https://example.com/endpoint
  method: GET        # Optional, defaults to GET if not specified
  headers:           # Optional
    content-type: application/json
  body: '{"key":"value"}'  # Optional, JSON string
```

See sample.yaml for full examples.
